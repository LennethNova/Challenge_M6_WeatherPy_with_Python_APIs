# Challenge_M6_WeatherPy_with_Python_APIs

# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
Based on the the Google API documentation and a random list of possible destinations, there is a need to create a travel map for desired cities with hotels taking the weather and preferences into account.

### This proyect includes:
- Retrieve Weather Data
- Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
- Create a Travel Itinerary Map

### Purpose
Summarize data into a map to create an intinerary for the prefered Country and Cities with their respective Hotels.

## Analysis and Challenges
The first challenge was to manage the API and understand the way the documentation worked. Once the tests worked, it was easier to follow the flow what was asked.

### Analysis of Outcomes
Using the CSV file made for the database, it generated possible locations that could be interesting while, the vacation seach narrowed the search by the preferred temperatures and generated a Hotel in the latitudes that were in the original database and it showed the places available. The last was for the intinerary that is preferred and a possible route that can be taken.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Still is difficult to understand try and except and some other code, but using Stack Overflow and also watching and reading documentation helped to complete the challenge.

## Results

- API KEY MUST NEVER GO IN ANY FILE
